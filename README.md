<p><b>I love collaborating with other developers</b>, if you have a project in mind lets build something!</p>
<p>I am currently working as a full-stack developer for a lottery / casino development firm. I work with existing lottery / casino systems,
and additionally, I make new and custom games / apps for the lottery / casino based clients. Additionally I have switched to doing freelance part time, and will only be working with 2 clients max. If you have a project, or app you need help with, feel free to message me and we can work something out!!!</b> :) </p>
